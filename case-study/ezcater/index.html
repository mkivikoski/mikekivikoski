      <h5 class="headline--minor">April to July, 2019</h5>

      <h1 class="headline--major">ezCater, an online marketplace for corporate catering valued at over $1,200,000,000 dollars, was growing a new team to handle the first point of contact to potential customers:â€¨
      <strong>their landing screens</strong>. </h1>
    </header>

    <section class="highlights">
      <h3 class="headline--major">The rapidly-expanding company was invested in understanding and presenting the correct content to users searching for business catering.</h3>

      <p>ezCater reached out to Cantina to optimize this customer experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop. Using A/B testing, prototyping, component-based design, fast iterations, and metric definitions, I defined and lead the UX and UI design of the five landing screen types.</p>

      <p>Over the course of 13 weeks, I lead the design of their 5 landing screens. 2 screens were existing, but lacked meaningful metrics. Recommendations on data we should collect, was recommended, before making large changes. The other 3 screens were designed from hypotheses, and visually used their internal design system, Recipe, as guidance.â€¨</p>
      <p>Several components were designed so they could be used across the screens and with different content or data. Based on some hypothesis, I created various layouts that could be used based upon the outcome of some of the data that was tracked (most of this data would be finalized after the engagement).</p>

      <p>Final deliverables included various page layouts for each landing type and interchangeable components, based upon recommended data to be tracked and desired content discovered in user interviews. This gave ezCater flexible options with their layouts and content for future tests, maximizing SEO, SEM and conversion rates.</p>
